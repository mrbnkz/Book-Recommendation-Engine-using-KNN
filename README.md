# Book-Recommendation-Engine-using-KNN
I would create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.

I will use the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

After importing and cleaning the data, use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book
